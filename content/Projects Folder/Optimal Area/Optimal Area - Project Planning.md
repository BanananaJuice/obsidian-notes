## Project Planning

This section will note down the different task to be completed in order to execute the entire project

### Phase 1: User Input and suburb identification
The first step in the process will be to determine the users input of the location of their work. From this information, we will scan the surrounding radius to determine all the postal codes within a 75km radius.

These postal codes will be the basis for our determination of commute times, quality of life indexes and average property prices

### Phase 2: Data Gathering
With the list of postal codes determined in Phase 1, we will need to scrape the web to obtain the average property price and quality of life index per area.

### Phase 3: Data Visualisation and Ranking
From the dataset determined in phase 3, we will need to rank the zip codes based on the criteria decided upon. This information will then be displayed on both an interactive map and in a table showing the top 3 suburbs
