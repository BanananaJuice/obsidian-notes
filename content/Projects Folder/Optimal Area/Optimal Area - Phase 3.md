## Objective
The objective of this phase of work was to visualise the data modelled in [[Optimal Area - Phase 2]], ideally on a map of sorts

## Summary of Work
Through research into different geospatial data visualisation, including looking at shape files and ARCGIS, I realised that many topics in this field would be out of my reach in terms of the knowledge I currently have.

I then turned to a tool I have been familiarised at work, PowerBI. Using heatmap add ins, I was able to visualise the data I had collated on a live map Cape Town then optimal areas to live in based. Quality of life is shown on a gradient from green (best) to red (worst) for ease of presentation
