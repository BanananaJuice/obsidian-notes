## Summary

**Fiscal debt** (often referred to as **public debt** or **government debt**) is the total amount of money that a government owes to creditors, both domestic and international. It is usually accumulated when a government spends more than it earns in revenue (like taxes) and needs to borrow money to cover the gap.
