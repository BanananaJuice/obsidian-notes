### Definition

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** is the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period, usually a year. It’s a key measure of a country's economic performance and indicates the size and health of its economy.

### Example

In one year, South Africa produces:
    - $10 billion worth of gold and platinum.
    - $5 billion worth of wine exports.
    - $15 billion worth of financial services.

The total **GDP** for South Africa in that year = $10B (mining) + $5B (wine) + $15B (finance) = **$30 billion.**

### Types of GDP

1. **Nominal GDP:**
    
    - This is the raw GDP figure in current prices.
    - Example: If South Africa’s nominal GDP is $30 billion in 2024, this doesn’t account for inflation.
    
1. **Real GDP:**
    
    - This adjusts for inflation to show true growth.
    - Example: If India’s GDP grows from $100 billion to $110 billion in nominal terms but inflation is 5%, the real growth is only $105 billion, not $110 billion.
    
1. **GDP per Capita:**
    
    - GDP divided by the population, giving an average economic output per person.
    - Example: If India’s GDP is $100 billion and its population is 1.4 billion, GDP per capita = $71.43.
    - South Africa with a GDP of $30 billion and a population of 61 million has GDP per capita = $491.80.

### GDP per Capita

GDP per capita is often used as a proxy for:

1. **Standard of Living:**
    
    - A higher GDP per capita suggests that, on average, people in the country may enjoy better living conditions and access to resources. However, it doesn't account for income inequality.
2. **Economic Productivity:**
    
    - It reflects how effectively a country is utilizing its resources (like labour and capital) to produce goods and services.
3. **Comparison Between Countries:**
    
    - It helps compare the economic performance of countries with different population sizes. For instance, a smaller country with a high GDP per capita might have a more prosperous population than a large country with a low GDP per capita.

### What is GDP (PPP)?

GDP (PPP) stands for Gross Domestic Product at [[Purchasing Power Parity]]. It adjusts the GDP of a country to account for differences in the cost of living and price levels between countries. Essentially, it reflects what you can buy with a certain amount of money in one country compared to another.

The goal of PPP is to make a more accurate comparison of economic productivity and living standards between countries.
