### How Does CPI Work?

1. **Basket of Goods:** CPI is calculated based on a standardized "basket" of items, which might include food, transportation, housing, clothing, healthcare, etc.
2. **Base Year:** A specific year is chosen as the baseline (CPI = 100). The prices of the basket in other years are compared to the base year.
3. **Formula:** 
$$
\text{CPI} = \frac{\text{Cost of Basket in Current Year}}{\text{Cost of Basket in Base Year}} \times 100
$$

### Example of CPI

1. **Base Year (2020):**
    
    - Basket includes:
        - Bread: $2
        - Milk: $3
        - Transportation: $50
        - Total Cost: $55
    - CPI for 2020 = 100 (Baseline).
2. **Current Year (2024):**
    
    - Same basket, but prices have increased:
        - Bread: $2.50
        - Milk: $3.50
        - Transportation: $55
        - Total Cost: $61
    - CPI for 2024: 6155×100=110.91\frac{61}{55} \times 100 = 110.915561​×100=110.91
    - **Interpretation:** The CPI is 110.91, meaning prices have increased by **10.91%** since 2020.
