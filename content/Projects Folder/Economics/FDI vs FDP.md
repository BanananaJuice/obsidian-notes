#### Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):

- **Definition:** FDI refers to an investment made by a company or individual in one country into a business located in another country. The investor typically seeks a lasting interest and **significant control** over the foreign business.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Involves physical assets like factories, plants, or offices.
    - Provides long-term economic benefits such as job creation and technology transfer.
    - Often requires regulatory approval by the host country.
- **Example:**
    - A U.S.-based company like Apple setting up a manufacturing plant in India is an example of FDI. Apple brings in capital, machinery, and expertise, contributing to India's local economy.

#### Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI):

- **Definition:** FPI involves investing in financial assets like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds in a foreign country **without seeking direct control** over the business.
- **Key Characteristics:**
    - Focuses on short-term financial gains rather than long-term involvement.
    - Investors can easily buy or sell these assets, making FPI more volatile compared to FDI.
    - Typically does not require regulatory approval, as it’s limited to financial markets.
- **Example:**
    - A foreign investor buying shares of South African companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is an example of FPI. While it injects capital into the stock market, it doesn’t directly influence the companies’ operations.
