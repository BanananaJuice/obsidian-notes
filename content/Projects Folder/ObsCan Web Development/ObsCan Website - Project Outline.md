## Summary

The aim of this project is to create and deploy a website for the ObsCanFeedYou charity, detailing the work they have performed as well as display the number of people fed each week.

The volunteers so far already track the number of people fed each weekend. I would like to create a backend database which stores this information and that it is easy for the volunteers to capture information to. This information should then also be presented on the website

### Phase 2: Understanding Databases

This stage will be performed with regards to understanding the various databases out there and how to integrate this with my website

### Phase 3: Chart Presentation and correlation

This phase will involve using the information in the database to create a chart to monitor the amount of homeless people fed per week as well as look into performing some correlation and predictive modelling between the homeless people fed and other features

### Phase 4: Database Updating Platform

This phase involved research into how to make an easy platform for volunteers to update the database without having to manually log into a separate system to input numbers
