## Background

Below is a high level overview of external projects and academic endeavours I have pursued outside of the current employment. Linked to each project is a detailed set of notes should anyone want to follow a similar path and try these projects for themselves.

### Optimal Area Modelling

#### Summary
The goal of this project was to model and identify the optimal areas to live in Cape Town, considering both work location and various quality-of-life factors sourced from census data.

The model allows users to input their work location, which is then processed through the Google Maps API to calculate commute times to and from work for each suburb in Cape Town. This commuting data is integrated with a broader dataset that evaluates the quality of life in each postal code, using information scraped from government websites and South African Census data.

The results are presented through a geospatial visualization built in Power BI, enabling users to easily identify the best areas to live based on their personal needs and preferences.

#### Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Maps API
- Pandas
- Power BI Geospatial visualisation
- Beautiful Soup Web Scraping

### Introduction to Machine Learning

#### Summary

This project marked my journey from having no prior experience to completing my first-ever machine learning project. I set an end goal of performing churn analysis on a publicly available telecommunications dataset and worked backward to identify the various aspects of statistics and coding I needed to learn along the way.

To organize my learning, I created a flow diagram outlining each key concept and skill, and I documented my notes for every stage. These notes cover the foundations of machine learning, statistics, and codingâ€”designed not only to guide my own learning but also to help others who are eager to move beyond the hype and actually build their first machine learning project.

The primary goal was to complete the churn analysis, but the project also aimed to serve as a practical resource for anyone looking to get started in machine learning.

#### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
